# WBEmoDialog

A Chinese conversation dataset for emotion detection task


WBEmoDialog: It is the dyadic Chinese text conversation dataset that we build, and includes six basic emotions(Happiness, Love, Sorrow, Fear, Disgust, None). Since each utterance is associated with emotion label in WBEmoDialog, we also split a dialogue with n utterances into n âˆ’ 1 sub dialogues
