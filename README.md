# WBEmoDialog

A Chinese conversation dataset for emotion detection task

DailyDialog(https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I17-1099/): This dataset was built by collecting conversations from English learning Websites, thus reflecting our daily way of communication. Each utterance is labeled by one of seven emotion labels, including Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise and Neutral.

WBEmoDialog: It is the dyadic Chinese text conversation dataset that we build, and includes six basic emotions(Happiness, Love, Sorrow, Fear, Disgust, None). Since each utterance is associated with emotion label in WBEmoDialog, we also split a dialogue with n utterances into n âˆ’ 1 sub dialogues
